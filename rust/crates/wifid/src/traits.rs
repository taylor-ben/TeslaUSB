//! The injected I/O **seams**. Every real side effect (monotonic time,
//! netlink / `wpa_supplicant` / `hostapd` / `dnsmasq` / `tc` / `rmmod`, the
//! gadgetd write-heartbeat, and the actual reboot) goes through one of these
//! traits, so the entire decision core in [`crate::link`], [`crate::throttle`]
//! and [`crate::watchdog`] is driven by fakes in unit tests on any host.
//!
//! The live implementations live in [`crate::exec`] and are
//! `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` HARDWARE-GATED stubs until the Phase-2 spikes
//! validate them on the Pi.
