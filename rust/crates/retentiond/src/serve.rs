//! Slice 6.1g — the **host-testable retention orchestrator**.
//!
//! Every pure decision (`folder` policy, `manifest` stability, the `RecentClips`
//! rotation estimate, value scoring, the governor tier machine, the crash-safe
//! single-deleter protocol) already lives in its own module behind a trait seam.
//! This module is the **loop** that ties them together: it owns the small amount
//! of cross-pass *state* the daemon must carry (the [`ManifestTracker`], the
//! [`RotationEstimator`], and last cycle's pure space tier) and drives the seams
//! in the correct order each cycle.
//!
//! It is deliberately **I/O-free**: facts about the car volume and the index
//! (what folders are present, what their manifests are, which rows need
//! recovery, the eviction value inputs) are passed in as plain value structs, and
//! all side effects go through the existing seams plus one new in-crate
//! [`Catalog`] seam. The live binary builds the live seam implementations
//! (`statfs`, the `gadgetd` eject-handoff client, the `indexd` RPC client, the
//! `scannerd` fact feed) and calls [`RetentionLoop::recover`] once at startup
//! then [`RetentionLoop::run_cycle`] on the governor cadence; this lane delivers
//! the orchestrator + its full host test suite, not the hardware glue.
//!
//! # The five phases
//!
//! 1. [`RetentionLoop::recover`] — reconcile any half-finished delete from a
//!    prior boot (the crash-safe recovery matrix) **before** anything else runs.
//! 2. [`RetentionLoop::archive_event_folder`] — per event folder: gate on
//!    `manifest` stability, run a verified archive pass, and (only when policy
//!    permits) request a car-side delete via the `gadgetd` handoff.
//! 3. [`RetentionLoop::mirror_recent`] — best-effort mirror of `RecentClips`
//!    into the archive (the card-fill-independent "don't lose footage before the
//!    car rotates it" guarantee) plus the rolling-quota mirror eviction plan.
//! 4. [`RetentionLoop::govern`] — evaluate the space tier and, under pressure,
//!    delete the least-valuable **safe** Pi-side item (honoring leases via the
//!    claim gate; failing closed when nothing is safe).
//! 5. [`RetentionLoop::health`] — project the assessment into the `StorageHealth`
//!    payload `webd` serves, and derive the [`UploadBackpressure`] signal
//!    `uploadd` consumes.
