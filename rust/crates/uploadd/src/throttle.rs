//! Consuming the `wifid` TX cap (contract **D4**) and `retentiond` storage
//! backpressure, plus the client-side [`Pacer`] that keeps a transfer under the
//! cap (the "belt").
//!
//! `uploadd` is the **consumer** in D4 ([`wifi-upload-throttle.md`]): `wifid`
//! owns and enforces the hard cap (kernel `tc`, the "braces") and publishes a
//! versioned [`WifiThrottle`]; `uploadd` subscribes and **self-paces** its own
//! transfer to the published `max_tx_bytes_per_s` / `max_chunk_bytes` so it can
//! never saturate the link or trip the SDIO deadlock — even if the kernel cap
//! were momentarily absent. Storage backpressure is a **separate plane**
//! ([`wifi-upload-throttle.md`] §2): a [`StoragePressure`] signal straight from
//! `retentiond`. The effective go/no-go is `wifi_allows && storage_allows`
//! ([`wifi-upload-throttle.md`] §2, [`crate::throttle::ThrottleSnapshot::gate`]).
//!
//! These types **mirror** `wifid::throttle` so the published shape and the
//! consumed shape stay byte-compatible; convergence onto
//! `teslausb-core::contracts::throttle` is the supervisor's. The cap numbers are
//! never hardcoded here — they arrive in the published state and are
//! `// CALIBRATION-GATED (Task 2.6)`.
