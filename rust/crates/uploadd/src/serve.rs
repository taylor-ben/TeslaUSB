//! The host-testable **upload scheduler** — the drain loop that turns a hydrated
//! [`crate::queue::UploadQueue`] into ordered, throttle-aware, lease-safe upload
//! work by repeatedly selecting the highest-priority ready item and handing it to
//! an [`UploadProcessor`].
//!
//! # Why a processor seam (and not just [`crate::engine::UploadEngine`])
//!
//! The per-item work — gate, lease, transfer, verify, mark durable — is already
//! pure and host-tested in two shapes:
//!
//! * [`crate::engine::UploadEngine`] streams the file in chunks (the in-process
//!   Rust-uploader path), and
//! * [`crate::rclone::RcloneUploadEngine`] uploads the whole file by shelling out
//!   to `rclone` (the chosen v1 backend).
//!
//! Both expose the *same* per-item contract: take a `&mut`
//! [`crate::queue::QueueItem`], do one end-to-end attempt, persist every
//! transition durably, and report a [`crate::engine::StepOutcome`]. The
//! [`UploadProcessor`] trait captures exactly that contract, so the scheduler is
//! generic over it and the same drain loop drives either backend. Tests inject a
//! deterministic fake processor.
//!
//! # What the scheduler adds on top of one item
//!
//! * **Priority + FIFO selection** ([`crate::priority`]): the next item is the
//!   lowest [`crate::priority::PriorityKey`] among the *ready* ones.
//! * **No head-of-line block on a lease denial.** A
//!   [`StepOutcome::SkippedLeaseDenied`] means `retentiond` has claimed the item
//!   for deletion; the item's queue state is intentionally left unchanged, so the
//!   scheduler parks it in a transient skip set for the rest of the drain pass
//!   (otherwise it would be re-selected forever). The set clears when the pass
//!   goes idle or uploads pause, so the next [`Scheduler::hydrate`] reaps the row
//!   `indexd` dropped.
//! * **Pause handling.** A [`StepOutcome::Paused`] (link down / AP mode / storage
//!   backpressure) stops the drain and tells the live loop how long to back off.
//! * **Idempotent (re)hydration.** [`Scheduler::hydrate`] rebuilds the in-memory
//!   index from the durable [`crate::queue::QueueStore`] snapshot, so newly
//!   archived items appear and deleted rows are reaped without duplicating work.
//!
//! # Live wiring (gated, not built here)
//!
//! The live `serve` binary path composes a [`Scheduler`] with the real `indexd`
//! [`crate::queue::QueueStore`] / [`crate::lease::LeaseClient`] /
//! [`crate::durability::DurabilityClient`] clients, the `wifid`
//! [`crate::throttle::ThrottleSource`] subscription, the `rclone`
//! [`crate::rclone::CommandRunner`], a real [`crate::time::Clock`] /
//! [`crate::time::Waiter`], and a stop flag. That wiring is hardware/IPC-gated and
//! depends on the Task 2.6 `WiFi` TX-cap calibration, so it lives in the gated
//! lane; this module delivers and proves the orchestration core.
