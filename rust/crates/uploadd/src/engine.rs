//! The orchestration **engine**: process one queued item end-to-end —
//! throttle-gate, acquire an upload lease, drive a paced + resumable +
//! integrity-checked transfer (renewing the lease by heartbeat), flag durability
//! on success, and always release the lease.
//!
//! This is where the queue, lease, throttle, transfer, and durability seams come
//! together. It is pure over those traits, so every branch — happy path, resume,
//! mid-transfer failure, integrity mismatch, a lost lease, a throttle pause, a
//! denied lease — is host-unit-tested with deterministic mocks and a synthetic
//! clock (no real sleeping, no real I/O).
//!
//! # Invariant guards live here
//!
//! - **Source only from the archive.** The only path the transfer ever opens is
//!   produced by [`crate::source::ArchiveRoot::resolve`]; a rejected path fails
//!   the item (retryable) and **never** reaches the uploader — the live LUN is
//!   unreachable.
//! - **Never delete.** There is no delete call anywhere in this flow; on success
//!   `uploadd` only flags `UPLOADED_VERIFIED`.
//! - **Never exceed the cap.** Every chunk is gated by the [`Pacer`] before it is
//!   read or sent.
//! - **Never evict mid-read.** The upload lease is held for the whole transfer
//!   and renewed on the configured cadence; a `Stale` renew stops the transfer.
