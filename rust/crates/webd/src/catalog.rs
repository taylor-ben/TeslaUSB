//! The read-only catalog handle.
//!
//! `webd` opens the `indexd` `SQLite` catalog with `SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`
//! (`indexd` is the sole writer, D1 §1). A [`Catalog`] is a cheap, clonable
//! handle around the database path; each request opens its own short-lived
//! read-only connection inside a blocking task, which sidesteps `Connection`'s
//! `!Sync` and keeps readers off the async runtime threads. WAL allows any
//! number of concurrent readers alongside the live `indexd` writer.
