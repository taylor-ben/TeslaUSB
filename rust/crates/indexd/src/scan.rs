//! Scan orchestrator — the in-process composition of the
//! `scannerd → indexd` seam.
//!
//! [`run_scan_pass`] is now a thin composition of the two halves the
//! cross-process daemons run over a local socket:
//!
//! ```text
//! producer (scannerd::produce::produce)  raw image → ScanBatch of facts
//! consumer (crate::apply::apply)         facts → SQLite catalog
//! ```
//!
//! Running both in one process is behavior-identical to the daemons
//! running them across the socket — that shared decomposition is what
//! keeps the parity tests meaningful for both paths. All raw byte parsing
//! lives in [`scannerd`] (the least-privilege producer); `indexd` only
//! ingests typed, validated, capped facts and writes the DB
//! (`indexd.md` §1/§3 — "No raw parsing or SEI decoding").
//!
//! ## Daemon loop
//!
//! Stability gating needs ≥2 observations spaced by the quiescence
//! window, so the binary calls [`run_scan_pass`] repeatedly (the tracker
//! and DB persist across passes); a single call is the per-tick unit and
//! is what host tests drive.
