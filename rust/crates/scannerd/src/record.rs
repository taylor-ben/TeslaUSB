//! The versioned `scannerd → indexd` fact contract.
//!
//! `scannerd` is the *only* process that touches untrusted, car-written
//! bytes (raw exFAT/MP4/SEI). It parses + stability-gates + extracts SEI
//! and emits the **facts** in this module to `indexd` over a local Unix
//! socket; `indexd` consumes them as **data** (never code), validates the
//! caps below, and writes the `SQLite` catalog. This type IS the trust
//! boundary: everything here is plain, bounded, `serde`-(de)serializable
//! data with no behavior that touches the image.
//!
//! Per [`scannerd.md`](../../../docs/specs/scannerd.md) §2.5 the records
//! carry *file identity, timestamps, partition, clip grouping, and the SEI
//! sample stream* — and nothing about trips/events (that is `indexd`'s
//! derivation, [`indexd.md`](../../../docs/specs/indexd.md) §1/§3).
//!
//! ## Versioning
//!
//! [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] is stamped into every [`ScanBatch`]. The consumer
//! rejects a mismatched major version rather than guessing. New optional
//! fields can be added behind `#[serde(default)]` without a bump.
