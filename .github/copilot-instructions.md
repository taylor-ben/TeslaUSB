# Copilot instructions — TeslaUSB

Binding working notes for any Copilot agent (CLI, cloud, code review) on this
repo. The code-quality charter (`docs/03-CODE-QUALITY-CHARTER.md`) wins on any
conflict; this file adds the operator directives below.

## Core engineering principles (binding)

These four disciplines govern every change; the charter still wins on any conflict.

### 1. Think before coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.** Before implementing:
state your assumptions explicitly and ask when uncertain; if multiple
interpretations exist, present them rather than silently picking one; if a simpler
approach exists, say so and push back when warranted; if something is unclear, stop,
name what's confusing, and ask.

### 2. Simplicity first

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.** No features beyond
what was asked; no abstractions for single-use code; no unrequested
"flexibility"/configurability; no error handling for impossible scenarios. If you
write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it. The test: "would a senior engineer
call this overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.** Don't "improve" adjacent
code, comments, or formatting; don't refactor what isn't broken; match existing
style even if you'd do it differently. Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR
change orphaned — but leave pre-existing dead code (mention it, don't delete it)
unless asked. Every changed line should trace directly to the request.

### 4. Goal-driven execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.** Turn tasks into verifiable goals
("add validation" → "write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"; "fix the
bug" → "write a failing test that reproduces it, then make it pass"; "refactor X" →
"ensure tests pass before and after"). For multi-step work, state a brief plan with
a verify check per step. Strong success criteria let you loop independently; weak
ones ("make it work") force constant clarification.

## Rust + TS only — no Python, ever (binding)

B-1 is **Rust** (daemons: `gadgetd`, `scannerd`, `indexd`, `webd`, `retentiond`,
`uploadd`, `wifid`, `schedulerd`) plus the **preact/TypeScript SPA** under `spa/`. **No Python**
in the shipped solution or the build/deploy surface — no runtime, Flask, Jinja,
gunicorn, or `.py` file.

The legacy **v1 app (`teslausb_web`, Flask) is REFERENCE ONLY.** Goal: re-create
v1's features, capabilities, and look-and-feel in Rust/TS, faster and with zero
clip loss. You MAY read v1 to recover an authoritative Tesla path, folder name,
or validation rule, and port the *behavior* idiomatically. You MUST NOT copy v1
Python (verbatim or line-translated) or reintroduce any Python.

## Builds — WSLC containers from PowerShell (binding)

All cross-builds run through **WSLC (Windows Subsystem for Linux Containers) on
the Windows host** (debian:bookworm, `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu` cross linker, target
`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, toolchain 1.85.0). WSLC ships with WSL as `wslc.exe`
(aliased `container.exe`, at `C:\Program Files\WSL\`) — a Docker-compatible CLI
that runs Linux containers natively on Windows, no Docker Desktop or podman
needed. **Do not** drop to a native WSL `cargo` build (slow, not reproducible);
drive `wslc` from PowerShell instead.

### Critical gotcha — invoke wslc from PowerShell, not WSL bash (saves trial-and-error)

`wslc.exe` is a **Windows** binary and its bind mounts take **Windows paths**
(`C:\...`), not WSL `/mnt/c/...` paths — so running `release/build-release.sh
--cross-wslc` from the only `bash` on this host (**WSL**, `bash --version` →
`x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`, paths `/mnt/c/...`) is fragile: the `/mnt/c/...` mount
sources won't resolve. So:

- **Run the container recipe directly via `wslc` from PowerShell** with `C:\...`
  bind-mount sources. This is the documented "mirror the container recipe" path
  and is the fast, reliable way here.
- WSLC `run` has **no `--mount` flag** — use Docker-style `-v`: a bind mount is
  `-v "C:\path:/target:ro"`, a named volume is `-v name:/target` (auto-created on
  first use; `wslc volume ls` to inspect).
- Reuse the **warm named volumes** so rebuilds are ~seconds, not minutes:
  `teslausb-cargo-target`, `teslausb-cargo-home`, `teslausb-rustup` (cross-build);
  `teslausb-test-target` + `teslausb-cargo-home` (tests). These are WSLC volumes —
  the old podman machine + its volumes are gone, so the first WSLC run is cold.
- **Build only the changed crates** with `-p <crate>` (e.g. `-p webd -p schedulerd`).
- If you pipe a host-authored `.sh` into the container, **strip CR first**
  (`tr -d '\r' < script.sh | bash`) — Windows-created files are CRLF and bash
  chokes on `\r`.

**Canonical cross-build (aarch64 bins) — PowerShell, warm volumes:**
```powershell
$repo = (Get-Location).Path           # C:\...\TeslaUSB
$out  = "$repo\release\.build\aarch64-bin"   # holds bin/<crate>
wslc run --rm `
  -v "${repo}:/src:ro" `
  -v "${out}:/out" `
  -v teslausb-cargo-target:/cargo-target `
  -v teslausb-cargo-home:/root/.cargo `
  -v teslausb-rustup:/root/.rustup `
  docker.io/library/debian:bookworm bash -lc "tr -d '\r' < /out/build.sh | bash"
```
where `/out/build.sh` mirrors `build-release.sh`'s inner recipe: apt-install
`build-essential pkg-config gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu file`,
rustup 1.85.0 + `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, copy `/src/rust`
to `/work/rust`, then
`export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/cargo-target`,
`export CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`,
`export CC_aarch64_unknown_linux_gnu=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`,
`cargo build --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu -p <crates>`, assert each
output is aarch64 (`aarch64-linux-gnu-readelf -h | grep AArch64`), `install -m0755`
to `/out/bin/<crate>`, and `sha256sum` it. First cold run does the apt+rustup
install into the volumes; subsequent runs skip it.

**Canonical test recipe (host-arch unit tests) — PowerShell, warm volumes:**
```powershell
wslc run --rm -v "${PWD}:/work" `
  -v teslausb-cargo-home:/cargo-home -v teslausb-test-target:/test-target `
  -e CARGO_HOME=/cargo-home -e CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/test-target `
  -w /work/rust docker.io/library/rust:1.85-bookworm `
  bash -c "cargo test -p teslausb-core -p schedulerd -p webd"
```
(Unix-socket crates don't build on Windows host cargo — use the container.)

For a full signed/manifested release artifact, `release/build-release.sh` is still
the source of truth for the staging/manifest/verify steps; on this host run its
`--cross-wslc` step's recipe directly from PowerShell (above). For a one-off
scoped binary deploy, the direct wslc call is enough.

## Speed & cost — risk-tiered effort (binding)

Match the rigor to the risk. The heavy machinery (parallel second opinion +
codex + review-until-clean + full Playwright) exists for changes where a bug is
expensive; applying it uniformly to low-risk work is the main source of slow,
costly iteration. **Default to the cheapest tier that fits; escalate by trigger.
When unsure which tier applies, pick the higher one.**

- **Tier 1 — Low risk.** Docs/comments/copy, CSS-only, test-only, config, or a
  single-file surgical change (≲40 lines) with no behavior change to a daemon, a
  contract, or the recording path. → **Opus edits directly at medium effort.** No
  parallel second opinion, no separate review agent — self-review against the
  five-axis checklist + the cheapest relevant test (unit and/or the one affected
  Playwright spec). Commit.
- **Tier 2 — Medium risk.** A feature or fix within one module/screen that is
  well understood and touches no recording path, `gadgetd`/handoff,
  `retentiond`/deletion, security, or shared contract. → codex implements; **one**
  review pass (cheaper model first — see Model division — escalate to GPT-5.5 only
  if it flags something real); cap the review loop at **1–2 cycles, not "until
  clean"**. Scoped tests + the affected Playwright spec(s) during iteration; one
  full UAT before commit.
- **Tier 3 — High risk.** Recording path, `gadgetd`/handoff state machine,
  `retentiond`/any delete, security, irreversible ops, cross-cutting architecture,
  shared contracts, or anything live-hardware/deploy. → **full rigor, unchanged:**
  mandatory parallel GPT-5.5 second opinion, codex implementation, GPT-5.5
  review-until-clean, the full Playwright protocol, and the hardware-test skill.
  No shortcuts here, ever.

**Fail fast, cheap first.** Within any tier, run gates cheapest→most expensive
and stop at the first failure: `tsc --noEmit` / `cargo clippy` → unit tests →
affected Playwright spec → *(only if green)* full UAT + a review agent. **Never
spawn a premium review or second-opinion agent on a diff that doesn't compile or
fails unit tests.**

## Model division of labor (binding)

The orchestrator is **Claude Opus 4.8**; it owns the session and routes work:

- **Plan / break-down / decide → Opus 4.8 (orchestrator).** Frames problems,
  designs the approach, owns `todos`/`todo_deps`/`plan.md`, sequences
  dependencies, and makes the final reconciled call. Opus does not delegate
  planning. **Defaults to medium reasoning effort** for routine orchestration;
  escalate to high/max only for genuinely hard planning or reconciliation.
  Mechanical loop steps (running builds/tests, greps, log capture, status edits)
  should be delegated to the `task`/Haiku agent rather than run inline at Opus
  rates.
- **Write code → `gpt-5.3-codex` (background sub-agent).** Substantive
  implementation (features, multi-file changes, porting v1 behavior) is delegated
  with a self-contained prompt: exact files, the contract, the constraints (this
  file + charter), and the acceptance tests to pass. **Tier 1 changes Opus edits
  directly; Tier 2–3 go to codex.** For a multi-step lane, keep **one persistent**
  background coder agent (multi-turn) rather than spawning a fresh stateless agent
  per micro-task — this stops re-transmitting files+contract+constraints every
  cycle. (Superseded `mai-code-1-flash-internal` on 2026-06-18 by operator
  directive — mai produced unreliable self-reported verification and unscoped
  workspace-wide reformatting; do NOT use mai for code.)
- **Review → tier-scaled.** **GPT-5.5 is the reviewer of record for Tier 3** and
  the escalation target for all tiers — adversarial reviews, second opinions,
  pre-deploy plan reviews. For **Tier 1–2** diffs a cheaper model
  (`gpt-5.4-mini` / `gemini-3.5-flash` / `claude-haiku-4.5`) does the first-pass
  review; escalate to GPT-5.5 only when it flags a real issue or the change is
  Tier 3. **Batch related small changes into one review break** rather than
  reviewing each micro-change.

Delegation routes work, not judgment: Opus verifies the coder's diff (builds/tests/
reads it) and reconciles review findings against the artifact rather than
rubber-stamping them.

## Implementation workflow — `docs/status.md` is the driver (binding)

`docs/status.md` is the single source of truth for what remains to reach parity
with `docs/Requirements.md`. Work it one item at a time through this loop; Opus
runs the loop and routes each step per "Model division of labor":

1. **Select** the next unchecked `[ ]` item from `status.md`. Respect its gates
   and the recommended build order — never start an item whose dependency
   (`gated:F1/F3/C1/…`) is unmet; prefer the foundation slice before features.
   Tier-C (operator/hardware-only) items are not started autonomously.
2. **Plan (Opus).** Design the implementation and break it into verifiable tasks
   (`todos`/`todo_deps`). **Check for an existing spec/task/ADR first** and
   validate it still aligns with the open item; **if it has drifted, fix the
   spec/task before coding.** Write one if none exists.
3. **Implement.** Tier 1: Opus edits directly. Tier 2–3: delegate the code to a
   `gpt-5.3-codex` sub-agent with the acceptance tests it must make pass.
4. **Review (tier-scaled).** Tier 1: self-review against the five-axis checklist.
   Tier 2: one cheaper-model pass (escalate to GPT-5.5 only if it flags something
   real), capped at 1–2 cycles. Tier 3: GPT-5.5 adversarial review, reconcile,
   **send issues back to the coder and re-review until clean** (bounded — escalate
   to the operator if it doesn't converge in a few cycles).
5. **Validate by test (cheap first).** Unit/integration for logic; Playwright for
   any UI change — **scoped to the affected spec(s) during iteration, full suite
   once before commit** (see below); the hardware-test skill for device behavior.
   A box is checked only after a tested-successful run.
6. **Update `status.md`.** Tick `[x]`, link the evidence (Playwright report /
   `files/hw-results.md` / test name), and commit the status update with the change.

### Parallelism — max throughput, zero collisions

Run as many items in parallel as can proceed **without collision or rework**:

- **Partition by non-overlapping surface.** Parallelize only items whose
  file/crate/module surfaces don't overlap (e.g. one SPA screen vs. a
  `retentiond` loop vs. a docs edit). If two would touch the same files (same
  module, same screen, the gadgetd handoff state machine, a shared contract),
  **serialize them.**
- **Gates are hard ordering.** Never parallelize an item with the foundation it
  is `gated:` on; encode this in `todo_deps`.
- **One writer per shared artifact.** `status.md`, `plan.md`, and each spec/
  contract have a single writer; Opus serializes edits and merges sub-agent
  results.
- **One self-contained coder lane per item**, each with its own files + tests;
  reviews fan out to GPT-5.5 per lane. Opus tracks lanes (`lanes`/`todos`),
  reconciles, and updates `status.md` once per completed item.
- **When unsure whether two items collide, assume they do and serialize.**

## Problem-solving — parallel GPT-5.5 second opinion (Tier 3)

For any **Tier 3 decision** (recording-critical, `gadgetd`/handoff, retention/
deletion, security, irreversible, architecture/contract-level, or live-hardware)
— and for any genuinely hard or surprising **Tier 2** call at orchestrator
discretion — don't rely solely on your own analysis: in parallel, launch a
`gpt-5.5` sub-agent with a self-contained prompt (symptoms, relevant files,
constraints, the specific question — it's stateless) to independently reach its
own conclusion while you form yours. Then **reconcile**: surface your view,
GPT-5.5's view, and the reconciled conclusion so the operator sees the reasoning;
treat disagreement as a reason to dig deeper. Re-check the final fix/plan with
GPT-5.5 before anything risky (live-hardware or recording-critical). Any
non-trivial code in the fix is implemented by GPT-5.3-codex, then reviewed by
GPT-5.5.

For **Tier 1–2** work a separate parallel second opinion is **not** required —
the tier-scaled code review already provides independent eyes; don't double-spend
a design opinion *and* a review on the same low-risk change.

## UI work — Playwright verification is non-optional (binding)

Any change affecting the rendered SPA (preact components/screens under `spa/`,
styles, `webd` API payloads the UI consumes — anything served on
`cybertruckusb.local`) must be verified end-to-end with Playwright before it is
"done". "Tests pass" and "endpoint returns 200" are not sufficient. Extend the
existing UAT suite under `spa/test/uat/` rather than starting from scratch.

**Tier the cost (binding).** During iteration, run only the **affected spec(s)**
at one viewport with `UAT_FAST=1` for a fast inner loop. The full six-step
protocol below — full suite, both viewports, perf + console + visual + wiring +
report — is the **pre-commit gate, run once** before the change is marked done.
Don't re-run 455×2 executions on every intermediate tweak; do run the full gate
exactly once before commit, and always for Tier 3.

For every UI-affecting change, the pre-commit gate asserts:

1. **Drive the real page** (headless Chromium against `http://cybertruckusb.local/…`
   when deployed, or a local `webd` + SPA dev server) — confirm the browser runs
   the JS, calls the expected `webd` endpoints, and renders.
2. **Assert on perf:** TTFB, DOMContentLoaded, first-contentful-paint, and
   per-request elapsed time; surface the slowest 5–10 requests. >~2 s to
   interactive on the Pi is not "fast" — keep iterating.
3. **Assert on console:** subscribe to `page.on("console")` / `page.on("pageerror")`;
   any error/warning/pageerror is a failure unless explicitly justified.
4. **Visually verify:** screenshot at mobile (375px) and desktop (≥1280px) and
   confirm the change actually renders — don't trust DOM-only assertions when the
   bug could be CSS/z-index/layout.
5. **Verify the wiring:** prove the changed module is actually loaded by the page
   (inspect the network waterfall and `<script>`/bootstrap state) — editing a
   module the page never loads is a real failure mode here.
6. **Report:** before/after timings, the network-request table, the console log,
   and the screenshot path.
