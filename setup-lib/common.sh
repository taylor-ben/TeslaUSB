# TeslaUSB B-1 installer — shared helpers (Task 7.1).
#
# Sourced by setup.sh and uninstall.sh. Defines paths, structured logging, and
# the SINGLE dry-run-aware mutation wrapper (`run_mutation`) that EVERY
# filesystem / systemctl mutation in the installer routes through. Nothing here
# mutates anything at source time; it only defines functions and path vars.
#
# The #1 invariant (contract §2): the installer NEVER creates, grows, lays out,
# moves, or deletes the car-facing backing image — that authority belongs solely
# to the gadgetd binary, reached only via gadgetd-provision.service. There is no
# raw image/partition tool anywhere in this file (contract §8 denylist).
#
# Sandbox: every system path is prefixed by ${TESLAUSB_PREFIX}, empty in
# production and a temp tree in the host tests, so tests never touch real
# /data or /usr/local.

# This is a library of constants/helpers consumed by the files that source it
# (setup.sh, uninstall.sh, modes.sh, units.sh, ...). shellcheck cannot see that
# cross-file usage when linting this file standalone, so SC2034 ("appears
# unused") is a false positive for every path/service constant below. Suppress
# it file-wide so the file lints clean both standalone and via `-x` from the
# entry points.
