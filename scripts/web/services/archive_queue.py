"""TeslaUSB Archive Queue — Phase 2a producer-side API (issue #76).

Persistent SQLite-backed queue of clips waiting to be copied from the
USB RO mount (RecentClips / SentryClips / SavedClips) to the SD-card
``ArchivedClips/`` directory. Lives in ``geodata.db`` alongside
``indexing_queue`` so a single migration / backup story covers both.

**Phase 2a is producer-only.** Three independent producers populate the
queue (the inotify file watcher, a 60-second full-directory rescan, and
a boot catch-up scan); nothing drains it yet. Rows accumulate harmlessly
until the Phase 2b worker lands. The Phase 2c watchdog + observability
endpoints will read the same queue.

Design constraints (Pi Zero 2 W, 512 MB RAM):

* **Lightweight imports only** — ``os``, ``sqlite3``, ``logging``,
  ``datetime``. Heavy libraries (cv2/av/PIL/numpy/requests)
  must never enter this module.
* **One connection per call** — every public function opens its own
  SQLite connection so the API is thread-safe by construction. No shared
  module-level connection.
* **Idempotent enqueue** — every producer can fire the same path many
  times; ``INSERT OR IGNORE`` on the ``source_path UNIQUE`` constraint
  makes this O(1) and lock-free at the application layer.
* **Best-effort metadata** — ``expected_size`` / ``expected_mtime`` are
  captured via ``os.stat()``; if the stat fails (file already rotated,
  permission denied, RO mount transiently gone) the row is still
  inserted with NULL metadata so the Phase 2b worker can decide what to
  do (it will detect ``source_gone`` on the actual copy attempt).

Public API
----------

* :func:`enqueue_for_archive` — single path, returns True iff a new row
  was inserted.
* :func:`enqueue_many_for_archive` — batch variant, returns the count
  of newly-inserted rows.
* :func:`get_queue_status` — counts per status (used by the Phase 2a
  observability stub and the Phase 2c watchdog).
* :func:`list_queue` — inspection helper for tests and Phase 2c UI.

The schema itself lives in :mod:`services.mapping_service` (the
``archive_queue`` CREATE statement is part of ``_SCHEMA_SQL`` so the
v9 → v10 migration creates it automatically). This module only reads
and writes rows.

Connection / transaction contract (Phase 2.10 — issue #97 item 2.10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Every public helper opens its own SQLite connection via
:func:`_open_archive_conn`. **The connection is opened in autocommit
mode** (``isolation_level=None``) so callers control transaction
boundaries explicitly. The contract is:

* **Single-statement reads or writes** — call ``conn.execute(...)``
  directly. Each statement auto-commits. Wrap the open/use/close
  pattern in ``try/finally`` (NOT ``with conn:``) — see below.

* **Multi-statement atomic operations** — use the
  :func:`_atomic_archive_op` context manager. It opens an autocommit
  connection, issues ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` (acquiring the write lock up
  front to avoid SQLITE_BUSY deadlocks), yields the connection, and
  on exit issues ``COMMIT`` on success or ``ROLLBACK`` on any
  ``BaseException`` (so ``KeyboardInterrupt`` / ``SystemExit`` also
  trigger rollback). Connection is always closed on the way out.

**Anti-pattern (do NOT use):** ``with _open_archive_conn(db_path) as conn:``.
Python's ``sqlite3`` module's ``with conn:`` is a transaction commit/
rollback context manager — but on an autocommit connection it does
NOT begin a transaction, only commits/rollbacks (which are no-ops
because each statement already committed). It also does NOT close
the connection. So that pattern is misleading on every axis: it
suggests transaction semantics that don't exist and leaks the
connection until garbage collection. Use ``try/finally`` for single-
statement work and :func:`_atomic_archive_op` for multi-statement.

#
# Lower number = more urgent. The Phase 2b worker picks rows in
# (priority ASC, expected_mtime ASC) order — the partial index
# ``archive_queue_ready`` covers exactly that ORDER BY.
#
# **Issue #178 — priority swap.** Pre-#178 the order was inverted:
# ``RECENT_CLIPS=1, EVENTS=2``. The original reasoning ("Tesla rotates
# RecentClips out after ~60 min, so they're the most urgent") was
# correct when the worker copied every RecentClip. After the SEI-peek
# skip-stationary path shipped (issue #167; made unconditional in
# issue #184 Wave 1), most RecentClips on a parked car became
# low-value skip-decisions and the priority order starved real Sentry
# events: live evidence on cybertruckusb showed 71 SentryClips events
# untouched for 130+ minutes while the worker burned its SDIO budget
# on parked-Sentry RecentClips skip decisions. Events are the
# highest-value footage (something physically happened to the car);
# RecentClips driving footage is dashcam-grade and gets the second
# tier; the SEI-peek skip-stationary path handles the parked-no-event
# case at copy time so it never competes with events for the queue
# head.
#
# A v13 schema migration (``mapping_migrations.py``) flips existing
# non-terminal rows on the first run after upgrade so the in-flight
# backlog also benefits.

PRIORITY_EVENTS = 1           # SentryClips / SavedClips — events are the highest-value footage

PRIORITY_OTHER = 3            # Default for anything else (e.g. ArchivedClips back-fill)

# Status values stored in the ``status`` column. Phase 2a only ever

    Phase 4.3 (issue #101) — surface "files Tesla rotated out before we
    could copy them" as a Settings banner. The truth signal is the
    archive_queue rows that the worker terminated as ``source_gone``
    (file vanished between enqueue and copy attempt — Tesla's
    RecentClips circular buffer rolled them off).

    Uses ``claimed_at`` as the timestamp filter. Rationale: by the time
    the worker calls :func:`mark_source_gone`, ``claimed_at`` has been
    set on the row (the worker always claims a row before stat'ing the
    source), and the source-gone determination happens within seconds
    of the claim. So ``claimed_at`` is the closest proxy for "when did
    Tesla lose this clip from our perspective". The :func:`mark_source_gone`
    precondition (``WHERE status='claimed'``) guarantees ``claimed_at``
    is never NULL on a ``source_gone`` row, so the counter cannot
    silently undercount because of an out-of-flow caller.

    **Dismissal floor (PR #169 follow-up)**: if a banner-dismissal
    tombstone is set (see :func:`set_lost_dismissed_at`), the lower
    bound is clamped to ``MAX(now-hours, dismissed_at)`` so previously-
    acknowledged losses don't repopulate the count when the worker
    immediately marks more files ``source_gone`` (catch-up backlog
    burst). When ``dismissed_at`` is ``None`` and ``ignore_dismissed``
    is False, the helper looks up the tombstone via
    :func:`get_lost_dismissed_at` (default behavior — what the banner
    poll wants). Pass ``ignore_dismissed=True`` to bypass the floor
    entirely (forward-looking override for any future caller that
    wants the raw, dismissal-agnostic count — e.g. a forensic admin
    view, or wiring the Failed Jobs page through this helper instead
    of the worker-snapshot ``source_gone_count`` it currently reads).

    Cheap COUNT(*) — uses the v11 partial index
    ``archive_queue_source_gone_claimed`` (``ON archive_queue(claimed_at)
    WHERE status = 'source_gone'``), which keeps the lookup O(log n)
    even though the ``archive_queue`` table grows monotonically (no
    retention today). On a v10 DB that hasn't been re-initialized yet
    this falls back to a full table scan, which is still acceptable
    because the table is bounded by row count rather than by free
    disk space (a few thousand ``source_gone`` rows COUNT in well
    under 100 ms even on the SD card). The ``hours <= 0`` guard plus
    the silent-on-error contract make this safe to call on every
    health-card poll.

    Returns 0 if the DB is missing, the table doesn't exist yet, or any
    SQLite error fires — never raises.

    Issue #163 — companion to :func:`count_source_gone_recent`. The
    "Footage may have been lost" home-page banner counts these rows
    and is intentionally persistent for 24 h so the operator notices
    the loss; this function powers the **Dismiss** affordance on that
    banner so the operator can clear the count once they've
    acknowledged it (instead of staring at the red banner for a full
    24 h after the catch-up backlog drains).

    ``source_gone`` is **terminal** — the source clip vanished before
    the worker could copy it; there is no retry path, no downstream
    table consumes the row, and the worker never re-claims it.
    Deleting these rows therefore has zero functional impact on the
    archive worker, indexer, cloud-sync, or any other subsystem; only
    the banner number changes.

    When ``older_than_hours`` is ``None`` (the default — what the
    Dismiss button passes), every ``source_gone`` row is deleted
    regardless of age. Callers that want to preserve very old rows for
    forensics can pass an integer to delete only rows older than that
    many hours (mirrors the ``hours`` parameter of
    :func:`count_source_gone_recent`).

    **Dismissal tombstone (PR #169 follow-up)**: when called from the
    Dismiss button (``older_than_hours=None``), this also writes the
    current timestamp via :func:`set_lost_dismissed_at` BEFORE the
    DELETE so a worker burst racing the dismiss cannot repopulate the
    banner — :func:`count_source_gone_recent` will floor the window at
    that timestamp on subsequent polls. Pass
    ``set_dismissal_tombstone=False`` to skip the tombstone write
    (e.g. for forensic / older-than-hours purges that aren't user
    acknowledgments). Tombstone-write failure is non-fatal: the DELETE
    still happens; the operator just won't get the suppression
    benefit if the worker repopulates between now and the next
    successful tombstone write.

    Wave 4 PR-F1 (issue #184): used by the archive worker when
    claiming from the unified ``pipeline_queue`` reader. The pipeline
    claim is atomic on the pipeline row but the legacy ``archive_queue``
    row is still ``pending`` until we mirror the status here. This
    helper exists to keep that mirror narrowly-scoped (one row by id)
    so it cannot accidentally claim some OTHER pending row in a race
    with the legacy reader.

    Behaviour mirrors ``claim_next_for_worker`` for one specific row:

    * Atomic conditional UPDATE — ``WHERE id=? AND status='pending'``.
      If the row was already claimed, deleted, or never existed, the
      rowcount is 0 and we return ``None``.
    * On success, returns the row dict (post-update) AND fires the
      pipeline_queue dual-write hook. In the PR-F1 caller flow the
      hook is **functionally idempotent** — the pipeline_queue row
      is already ``in_progress`` because the caller claimed it via
      ``pipeline_queue_service.claim_next_for_stage`` before invoking
      us, so re-writing ``status='in_progress'`` is a write of the
      same value and does not reset ``attempts``, ``claimed_at``, or
      any other column. Keeping the hook call is intentional so a
      future caller invoking this helper directly (without a prior
      pipeline_queue claim) still keeps the two tables in sync.

    Args:
        row_id: ``archive_queue.id`` to claim.
        claimed_by: Stamped into ``claimed_by`` for diagnostics.
        db_path: Override the default ``geodata.db`` path.

    Returns:
        The claimed row as a plain ``dict`` (with the post-update
        ``status='claimed'`` / ``claimed_at`` / ``claimed_by``
        values), or ``None`` if the row is missing / already claimed

      * Lock contention — if ``task_coordinator.acquire_task`` times
        out, we shouldn't penalize the row for our own scheduling.
      * Pause/stop — when the worker shuts down mid-claim, the row
        goes back to ``pending`` so the next worker (or restart) can
        re-claim it cleanly.

    Optionally refreshes ``expected_size`` / ``expected_mtime`` so the
    next pick-and-claim sees the latest stat() values.
