    The canonical form is a POSIX-style path **relative to one of the
    well-known TeslaCam folders** (``ArchivedClips``, ``RecentClips``,
    ``SentryClips``, ``SavedClips``, ``TeslaTrackMode``):

    * ``/`` separators only (Windows backslashes converted defensively).
    * No leading slash.
    * No trailing slash.
    * No ``//`` or ``./`` components.
    * **No ``..`` components** — these are rejected with ``ValueError``
      because they have no legitimate place in a cloud-sync row name and
      ``remove_from_queue`` is reachable from raw user input
      (``cloud_archive.py`` POST handler), so a ``..`` collapse via
      ``posixpath.normpath`` could be exploited to reference a row the
      user shouldn't be able to address.

    Absolute paths under any of those known roots have everything before
    the root segment stripped. Examples::

        /home/pi/ArchivedClips/2026-01-01-front.mp4
            -> ArchivedClips/2026-01-01-front.mp4

            -> SentryClips/2026-01-01_10-00-00
        ArchivedClips/foo.mp4/      (corrupt trailing slash)
            -> ArchivedClips/foo.mp4
        /home/pi/ArchivedClips//bar.mp4
            -> ArchivedClips/bar.mp4

    Paths that don't contain a known root segment have their leading /
    and trailing / stripped but are otherwise preserved (this should
    never happen for legitimate cloud-sync rows; treat such paths as
    suspect but don't drop them).

    Empty / falsy input is returned unchanged so callers can pass
    optional values without a guard.

# Background Sync State
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 3b (#99) — continuous worker model
# ---------------------------------------
# The cloud sync used to be a one-shot: every trigger (timer tick, NM
# dispatcher fire, manual UI button, mode switch) spawned a new daemon
# thread that ran ``_run_sync`` to completion and exited. That pattern
# had three structural problems:
#
# 1. Newly-archived clips couldn't upload until the *next* trigger.
#    Inotify saw the file, the indexer caught up — but cloud sync only
#    woke on the 24h safety timer or on a WiFi reconnect event.
# 2. Wave 4 PR-F4 (issue #184): live-event uploads (Sentry/Saved) are
#    now first-class ``pipeline_queue`` rows at ``PRIORITY_LIVE_EVENT``
#    instead of a separate ``live_event_sync`` subsystem with its own
#    queue, worker, and yield-coordination. The unified worker's
#    natural priority ordering means a live event always leapfrogs
#    bulk catch-up rows on the very next claim — no separate LES
#    head-start, no inter-file yield dance, no second rclone
#    subprocess.
# 3. Status was scattered across "sync running?" (in ``_sync_status``)
#    and "thread alive?" (in ``_sync_thread``) — two different sources
#    of truth that periodically disagreed.
#
# Replaced with the LES pattern: a single long-lived worker thread that
# blocks on ``_wake.wait(timeout=N)`` when idle (~0.1 % CPU baseline)
# and drains the queue when poked. Producers (file watcher, NM
# dispatcher, manual UI, mode switch) call ``wake()`` instead of
# ``start_sync()``; the worker is always there waiting. ``start_sync``
# remains as a backward-compat alias that ensures the worker is alive
# and pokes it.

# ``stop_sync()`` sets this to interrupt the current upload pass;
# ``_worker_loop`` clears it after the drain returns so the worker
# stays alive and will respond to the next ``wake()``. ONLY ``stop()``
# (terminal worker shutdown) sets ``_worker_stop`` — confusing the two
# would kill the worker on every "Stop Sync" UI click and silently
# drop subsequent file-watcher / NM dispatcher / mode-switch wakes.
_drain_cancel = threading.Event()

    """Drop the orphaned ``live_event_queue`` table from cloud_sync.db.

    Issue #202 — Wave 4 PR-F4 (issue #184 / PR #201) deleted the
    standalone Live Event Sync subsystem (the service, blueprints,
    routes, and config block). The ``live_event_queue`` table created
    by that subsystem was deliberately left behind so any rows still
    pending at deploy time could survive a rollback. After at least
    one stable release post-PR-F4, the table is now safe to drop:
    every install has had time to either (a) drain the table to zero
    via the cloud worker (which now reads from ``pipeline_queue``
    priority-0 rows), or (b) leave it untouched at zero rows because
    LES was never enabled on that install.

    Defensive cross-DB check (the issue body explicitly asks for this):
    if the table contains any rows, verify each row is mirrored into
    ``pipeline_queue.legacy_table='live_event_queue'`` in geodata.db.
    For any unmirrored rows, log a WARNING with the row IDs and
    backfill them via :func:`pipeline_queue_service.dual_write_enqueue`
    BEFORE the DROP, so no live-event upload work is lost. This is a
    safety net — the canonical install verified pre-merge had 0 rows
    on both sides — but it remains the correct shape because some
    third-party install may have captured rows between PR-F4 deploy
    and this PR's deploy.

    Order:
      1. Existence check (no-op if table already absent).
      2. Defensive zero-row check + cross-DB mirror reconciliation
         (backfill missing mirrors AND re-verify after the loop —
         see :func:`_backfill_missing_live_event_mirrors` for the
         post-loop verification that closes the silent-data-loss
         path through ``dual_write_enqueue``'s ``sqlite3.Error →
         return False`` branch).
      3. Drop secondary indexes (``idx_les_status``,
         ``idx_les_next_retry``).
      4. Drop the table itself (autoindex from UNIQUE drops with it).

    The caller (``_init_cloud_tables``) wraps this in a
    ``try / except → conn.rollback() → migration_ok=False``
    envelope. On any exception here the version bump is skipped and
    the migration retries on next service start. Crucially, the call
    site is gated on ``migration_ok`` being True from prior versions
    so a v2 failure does not allow v4 work to land in a fresh
    implicit transaction that downstream commits would persist
    (review-pr finding #3).

    missing mirrors at ``priority=PRIORITY_LIVE_EVENT,

    when the legacy row was already ``'uploaded'``) so the unified

    Stale-mirror handling (review-pr finding #5): if a non-canonical
    install mirrored a row at LES ``status='pending'`` time and LES
    later finished the upload, the legacy row will say
    ``status='uploaded'`` while the mirror still says ``cloud_pending``.
    For each such row we UPDATE the mirror's stage to ``cloud_done``
    and status to ``done`` so the worker doesn't re-upload completed

    Status mapping mirrors the deleted ``_backfill_live_event_queue``:
    legacy ``uploaded`` → unified ``done`` at ``stage='cloud_done'``;
    legacy ``uploading`` → unified ``in_progress``; legacy ``failed``
    → unified ``failed``; everything else → ``failed`` (review-pr
    finding #4 — conservative default; an unknown legacy status

    ``dual_write_enqueue``'s ``sqlite3.Error → return False`` branch
    (which only logs a WARNING in pqs) into the documented

# Three opt-in flags lay the foundation for PR-F3's reader cutover:
#
#   * ``CLOUD_ARCHIVE_ENQUEUE_TO_PIPELINE`` — PRODUCER. When True,
#     ``_discover_events`` enqueues each event into ``pipeline_queue``
#     with ``stage='cloud_pending'`` (idempotent via the existing
#     UNIQUE index). The legacy disk-walk + ``cloud_synced_files``
#     path continues to drive uploads — the producer hook only
#     POPULATES the unified queue so PR-F3's ``claim_next_for_stage``
#     reader has rows to claim instead of an empty table.
#
#   * ``CLOUD_ARCHIVE_SHADOW_PIPELINE_QUEUE`` — OBSERVABILITY. When
#     True (and the producer is also True), ``_drain_once`` peeks at
#     the top-N ``cloud_pending`` rows in ``pipeline_queue`` before
#     each upload pass and logs WARNING if the legacy reader's first
#     pick is absent from the pipeline's top-N window. Pure
#     observability — no behavioural change. Skipped when the
#     producer is OFF (would always disagree — no rows to compare)
#     and when the reader is ON (we ARE the pipeline reader, moot
#     comparison).
#
#   * ``CLOUD_ARCHIVE_USE_PIPELINE_READER`` — RESERVED for PR-F3.
#     Read here only for the shadow-skip predicate; PR-F3 will wire
#     the actual reader switch.
#
# All three default OFF (except the shadow flag which defaults ON
# but is gated on the producer flag) so a fresh deploy is a no-op
# pending operator opt-in.

        event_size: Total size in bytes (informational; stored in

            Pass ``PRIORITY_LIVE_EVENT`` (= 0) from the file_watcher
            event.json hook to leapfrog the bulk catch-up queue.

def enqueue_live_event_from_event_json(event_json_paths: List[str]) -> int:
    """Enqueue Sentry/Saved events at LIVE priority into pipeline_queue.

    Wave 4 PR-F4 (issue #184): replaces the standalone
    ``live_event_sync_service`` worker. The file_watcher's
    ``register_event_json_callback`` fires this helper the moment Tesla
    writes a new ``event.json``; the unified cloud_archive worker (now
    a ``pipeline_queue`` reader after PR-F3 + flag flip) picks the row
    up before any bulk catch-up rows because the row is enqueued at
    ``PRIORITY_LIVE_EVENT = 0`` (vs. ``PRIORITY_CLOUD_BULK = 4``).

    The caller is the file_watcher inotify callback. Callbacks are
    invoked from the watcher thread so this MUST be cheap and MUST
    NEVER raise: failures only delay the upload by one bulk-discovery
    cycle (the next ``_discover_events`` pass will pick up the same
    event at the bulk priority).

    Canonical key — IMPORTANT
    -------------------------
    The ``source_path`` we enqueue MUST exactly match the form
    :func:`_discover_events` produces for the same event so the
    ``pipeline_queue.idx_pipeline_source_unique`` UNIQUE index dedups
    correctly. ``_discover_events`` enqueues the **event directory** as
    ``canonical_cloud_path("SentryClips/<dir>")`` — NOT the event.json
    path inside it. This helper therefore derives the directory from
    the inotify event_json path and runs the SAME canonicalisation.
    Mismatch = double-upload (one row at LIVE priority, one at BULK) —
    the regression PR-F4's review caught and this docstring exists to
    prevent recurrence.

    For each ``event.json`` path:

    * Compute the event directory (``os.path.dirname``); skip if the
      dir vanished between the inotify event and this call.
    * Canonicalise the **event directory** (not the event.json path)
      via :func:`_canonical_rel_path_from_local` so the resulting
      ``source_path`` matches the bulk producer's form exactly.
    * Compute the event size by summing the file sizes in the event
      directory; falls back to ``0`` if the dir vanished mid-call.
    * Call :func:`_enqueue_event_to_pipeline` with
      ``priority=PRIORITY_LIVE_EVENT`` and a ``producer`` tag that
      identifies this code path in pipeline forensics.

    Returns the count of newly-inserted rows. Re-enqueues that hit
    the UNIQUE index (the same event dir processed twice, OR a bulk
    discovery beat us to it) count as no-ops.

    """Compare the legacy disk-walk's first pick against the pipeline top-N.

    Mirrors :func:`archive_worker._shadow_compare_picks` for the cloud
    queue. The legacy ``_discover_events`` ranker uses
    ``_score_event_priority`` (event > geo > none) while
    ``pipeline_queue`` orders by ``priority, enqueued_at, id``.

    Cloud-specific subtlety: every ``cloud_pending`` row enqueued by
    the producer hook lands at the same ``PRIORITY_CLOUD_BULK`` value
    (the per-event score is stored in ``payload_json`` for PR-F3 but
    NOT used as the queue's primary sort key). So the pipeline reader's
    intra-band order collapses to ``enqueued_at, id`` — purely the
    discovery-time sequence. That diverges in two benign ways from
    the legacy disk-walk's ranking:

    * **Score reordering.** The legacy reader sorts by score; a high-
      priority Sentry event arriving after a long backlog band of
      lower-score clips lands at the BOTTOM of the pipeline top-N
      (newest enqueued_at) but at the TOP of the legacy pick. PR-F3's
      claim path will need to honour the score-from-payload to match
      the legacy ranker; until then this manifests as a top-N miss.
    * **Discovery cadence.** The legacy disk-walk re-sorts every
      ``_drain_once``; pipeline rows preserve their original
      enqueued_at across drains, so an event re-enqueued by an
      idempotent producer doesn't bubble up.

    To absorb both, agreement requires only that the legacy pick
    appear ANYWHERE in the pipeline's top-N window. Only when it's
    absent (a real producer-hook gap — a file the legacy walker
    found that the producer somehow missed enqueueing) does the
    WARNING fire.

    Empty queue case: both ``legacy_path`` is ``None`` AND
    ``pipeline_candidates`` is empty ⇒ both readers say "queue
    empty" ⇒ counted as agreement, no log. If the legacy reader has
    work but the pipeline doesn't, that's a benign ordering case
    (the producer enqueued but pipeline_queue's WAL hasn't
    propagated yet — extremely rare); we treat it as a benign miss
    rather than a gap.

    Disagreement logging is rate-limited identically to the archive
    shadow: first ``_CLOUD_SHADOW_DISAGREEMENT_LOG_VERBATIM``
    mismatches log verbatim, then one heartbeat WARNING per
    ``_CLOUD_SHADOW_DISAGREEMENT_LOG_EVERY``.

# Wave 4 PR-F3 (issue #184): cloud reader-switch helpers
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PR-F3 mirrors PR-F1's archive-worker reader switch for cloud_archive.
# When ``CLOUD_ARCHIVE_USE_PIPELINE_READER`` is True (default OFF), the
# drain pass replaces the disk-walk + ``cloud_synced_files`` filter with
# a batch ``claim_next_for_stage`` against ``pipeline_queue``. The
# upload loop body is structurally unchanged — it still iterates a list
# of ``(event_dir, rel_path, event_size)`` tuples — so the existing
# state-transition dual-write hooks (PR-B) drive the pipeline_queue row
# from ``in_progress`` (set by claim) to ``done`` (set by the
# ``cloud_synced_files`` UPDATE on success) without any new wiring.
#
# Cloud rows are mirrored from ``cloud_synced_files`` LAZILY: the
# producer in ``_discover_events`` enqueues with
# ``source_path = canonical_cloud_path("SentryClips/<event_dir>")`` (the
# event DIRECTORY, NOT the event.json file inside it) but does NOT set
# ``legacy_id`` because the corresponding ``cloud_synced_files`` row is
# not created until upload starts. The PR-F4 live-event hook
# (:func:`enqueue_live_event_from_event_json`) MUST canonicalise the
# event directory the same way so the ``idx_pipeline_source_unique``
# index dedups across producers — see that helper's "Canonical key"
# docstring section. That's also why the release-claim helper uses the
# cloud-specific :func:`pqs.release_pipeline_claim_by_source_path`
# (added by PR-F3) instead of the legacy_id-keyed PR-F1 helper.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Default upper bound on the number of rows claimed in a single drain
# pass. The legacy disk-walk has no equivalent — it sees everything in
# ``_discover_events`` then trims by cloud capacity. The reader path
# claims a bounded batch so a cancel/error doesn't strand an unbounded
# number of in_progress rows. ``recover_stale_claims_pipeline`` will
# eventually release stragglers if the worker crashes mid-batch, but
# bounding the batch keeps the recovery surface small.

    Wave 4 PR-F3 (issue #184): the cloud-side mirror of
    :func:`archive_worker._claim_via_pipeline_reader`.

    Returns a list of ``(event_dir, rel_path, event_size)`` tuples
    shaped exactly like ``_discover_events`` so the existing
    ``_drain_once`` upload loop can iterate the result without any
    branch-by-branch changes.

    Each successful claim atomically sets ``status='in_progress'``,
    bumps ``attempts``, and persists ``claimed_by`` / ``claimed_at``.
    Caller responsibilities:
      * On upload success → existing PR-B dual-write hook fires from
        ``cloud_synced_files`` UPDATE → pipeline row goes to
        ``status='done'``. No PR-F3-specific code required.
      * On upload failure → existing PR-B failure-mirror dual-write
        hook updates ``last_error`` / ``attempts``. No PR-F3-specific
        code required.
      * On early cancel (cancel event fires mid-batch, leaving N
        unprocessed claims) → caller MUST call
        :func:`_release_cloud_pipeline_claims` with the unprocessed
        ``rel_path`` list so those rows return to ``status='pending'``
        and don't accrue ``attempts`` for work that never started.

    Defensive cases (data-shape gaps that should never happen in
    production but are handled instead of silently corrupting the
    queue):
      * Pipeline row missing ``source_path`` → moved to
        ``status='dead_letter'`` (unrecoverable; an empty path is not
        something a recovery cycle can fix). One WARNING per
        occurrence — operators inspect via
        ``/api/pipeline_queue/dead_letter``.
      * Pipeline row's ``payload`` missing ``event_dir`` → released
        back to ``pending`` so the next ``_discover_events`` pass
        can re-enqueue with the correct payload. One WARNING per
        occurrence.

    The cloud reader claims a BATCH up front (vs. the per-row claim
    archive_worker uses) because cloud_archive's drain loop is built
    around iterating a discovered list, not "claim → process → claim
    again". Re-shaping the loop to per-row claim would be an
    invasive refactor with no measurable upside (cloud's per-event
    dwell time is dominated by the rclone subprocess, not the claim
    overhead).

def _load_geo_hits(db_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[Set[str]]:
    """Pre-fetch the set of "anchors" — strings that legacy
    ``_score_event_priority`` would match via ``LIKE '%dir_name%'`` —
    extracted from every non-NULL ``waypoints.video_path`` row.

    Phase 5.2 — replaces the per-event ``get_db_connection() → SELECT … LIKE``
    pattern in :func:`_score_event_priority`. For a queue with N candidate
    events the legacy code opened N fresh SQLite connections and ran one
    full-scan ``LIKE '%dir%'`` query each. This helper does ONE connection
    and ONE ``SELECT DISTINCT video_path`` then derives every possible
    ``dir_name`` anchor in Python (set-build) so the per-event check
    collapses to an O(1) ``in`` lookup.

    The legacy LIKE substring pattern actually accepts THREE anchor shapes
    because :func:`_discover_events` calls the scorer with two different
    ``event_dir`` shapes:

      * **Nested event dirs** (``SentryClips/2026-05-12_10-00-00``) —
        ``dir_name`` is a 19-char timestamp.
      * **Flat ArchivedClips files** (``ArchivedClips/2026-05-12_10-00-00-front.mp4``) —
        ``dir_name`` is the full filename (``os.path.basename`` of the
        FILE, not a directory).

    And ``waypoints.video_path`` in production is stored as
    ``ArchivedClips/<basename>`` — never the original nested
    ``SentryClips/<event-dir>/<file>`` form. So we MUST look at the
    file's basename and the leading-19-char timestamp prefix, not
    just the parent-dir basename. (PR #143 reviewer caught this: the
    parent-dir-only build always produced ``"ArchivedClips"`` and
    silently demoted geo-tier events to the no-geo tier, which under
    ``sync_non_event_videos: false`` would drop them from the queue.)

    For each ``video_path`` we add three anchors to the set:
      1. ``os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(vp))`` — catches the
         nested-event-dir naming pattern (``RecentClips`` /
         ``ArchivedClips`` are always added but never collide with a
         real event-dir name, so they're harmless noise).
      2. ``os.path.basename(vp)`` — catches the flat-ArchivedClips
         file-basename naming pattern.
      3. The leading 19-char ``YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`` timestamp prefix
         of the file basename — catches the nested-event-dir case
         even when the indexer has rewritten the path to flat form
         (which is the production situation).

    Uses raw ``sqlite3.connect`` rather than
    ``mapping_queries.get_db_connection`` because the latter runs the
    full v6 schema initialization on every call. This helper is
    read-only and called once per discover pass — schema migration is
    a different lifecycle and belongs in the indexing path, not the
    cloud picker. Skipping it also means ``_load_geo_hits`` doesn't
    crash when geodata.db is missing or partially initialized: it
    returns ``None`` so the scorer falls back to the legacy per-event
    query path.

    Returns:
      * a ``set`` of anchor strings (may be empty if waypoints table
        has no rows) — caller should use ``in`` for the per-event check.
      * ``None`` if mapping is disabled, the DB doesn't exist, or the
        query raises (no waypoints table, locked, etc.) — caller MUST
        treat ``None`` as "fall back to per-event lookup" so behaviour
        matches the legacy code path.
