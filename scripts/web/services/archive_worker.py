"""Single-threaded archive worker (issue #76 — Phase 2b).

Drains the ``archive_queue`` table one file at a time. For each row:

1. Pick + claim the next ``pending`` row, ordered ``priority ASC,
   expected_mtime ASC NULLS LAST`` (RecentClips first, then
   Sentry/Saved, then everything else; closest-to-Tesla-rotation first
   within each band).
2. Run a "fully written" gate: re-stat the source; if the file is
   younger than 5 s AND its size or mtime drift past the values seen
   when it was enqueued, release the claim with refreshed metadata and
   try again on the next iteration. Tesla writes clips in chunks; we
   never want to copy a half-written clip.
3. Acquire the ``task_coordinator`` slot. The archive worker is a
   periodic priority task (per the task_coordinator contract docstring),
   so it uses the **blocking** ``acquire_task('archive', wait_seconds=N)``
   form — it waits a bounded time for the indexer to yield, then
   proceeds. NOT the indexer's ``yield_to_waiters=True`` cyclic form.
4. Compute the destination under ``ARCHIVE_DIR`` mirroring the
   ``TeslaCam/<sub>/<file>`` layout.
5. Atomic copy: stage to ``<archive_root>/.staging/<hash>-<name>.partial``
   in 1-MiB chunks, ``fsync``, ``os.replace`` to the final name,
   verify size matches the source. The single staging dir keeps the
   archive tree free of in-flight bytes (so directory traversals
   never trip on partials) and reduces orphan-sweep cost from
   ``os.walk`` to one ``os.scandir`` (issue #184 Wave 3 — Phase H).
6. On success, mark the row ``copied`` and enqueue the **destination**
   path into ``indexing_queue`` via
   ``indexing_queue_service.enqueue_for_indexing`` so the indexer
   picks it up next.
7. Failure handling:
   * ``FileNotFoundError`` (source rotated by Tesla mid-flight) → mark
     ``source_gone``. No retry, no dead-letter.
   * Any other ``OSError`` / ``shutil.Error`` / ``sqlite3.Error`` →
     bump ``attempts``; at ``attempts >= retry_max_attempts`` the row
     transitions to ``dead_letter`` and a sidecar text file lands at
     ``~/ArchivedClips/.dead_letter/<id>.txt`` for forensics.

**Hard contract (do NOT break — see copilot-instructions.md):**

* This module never imports or calls anything that touches the USB
  gadget — no ``mount``, ``umount``, ``losetup``, ``nsenter``,
  ``partition_mount_service``, ``quick_edit_part2``, or
  ``rebind_usb_gadget``. Tesla may be actively recording; ANY USB
  disruption from a background subsystem loses footage.
* The ``task_coordinator`` lock is **always released before any sleep**.
  Holding the lock across ``_stop_event.wait()`` was the May 7
  starvation bug — never re-introduce it.
* No heavy imports. ``os``, ``shutil``, ``sqlite3``, ``logging``,
  ``threading``, ``time`` only — the Pi Zero 2 W steady-state RSS
  budget for this thread is ~30 MB.

    Backstop #2 (this is the safety net for the "stable+corrupt" case):

    Phase 2.4 — A "successful" copy of an unplayable MP4 is worse than
    a failed copy: the bad file looks complete (size matches), gets
    indexed (with errors), shows up in the UI, and refuses to play.
    Tesla writes the ``moov`` atom at the END of the file, so a copy
    that started before Tesla finished writing will have everything up
    to and including ``mdat`` but be missing ``moov``.

    Issue #110 — Tesla's RecentClips writer also produces clips with
    ``moov`` near the START of the file (before ``mdat``). A copy
    snapshotted between the moov and mdat writes has moov but no mdat,
    and the pre-#110 verifier (which returned True on the first moov
    box) accepted these. The indexer's SEI parser then bailed with
    "No mdat box found" and the row eventually dead-lettered. Both
    boxes are now required.

    Implementation notes (Pi Zero 2 W constraints):

    * **Streaming, not full-file load.** We read 8-byte box headers and
      ``seek`` past each box's payload. Total IO for a typical Tesla
      clip is ~24-32 bytes regardless of file size — no risk of mmap
      pressure on multi-GB recordings.
    * Handles 32-bit, 64-bit (``size==1``), and to-EOF (``size==0``)
      box sizes per ISO BMFF. The pre-existing ``_is_complete_mp4``
      in ``video_archive_service`` did NOT handle the 64-bit / 0
      cases — this verifier intentionally does, so a future Tesla
      firmware that emits 64-bit box sizes won't trigger spurious
      moov-missing failures.
    * A bounded number of header reads (``_MOOV_VERIFY_MAX_HEADER_READS``)
      prevents a malformed / non-MP4 input from spinning the walk
      forever.
    * Any IO error is treated as ""not verified"" (returns False) so
      the caller falls back to the retry path — matches the
      conservative ""verify-or-fail"" contract the issue specifies.

    """Copy ``source_path`` → ``dest_path`` atomically. Returns size.

    Pattern (Phase H, issue #184 Wave 3): write to a uniquely-named
    ``.partial`` file inside ``staging_root`` (a single ``.staging``
    directory under the archive root), fsync, then ``os.replace``
    into the final destination. The staging dir lives on the same
    filesystem as the destination so the rename is atomic.

    When ``staging_root`` is ``None`` (back-compat for direct test
    callers), partials still go to ``dest_path + '.partial'`` — the
    old in-tree pattern. Production callers always pass
    ``staging_root`` so partials never appear in the archive tree.

    Verifies the rendered size matches the source's stat() size; any
    mismatch raises ``OSError`` so the caller bumps attempts.

    Mid-copy SDIO-contention safeguards (issue #104, extended in #109):

    * If ``chunk_pause_always`` is True (issue #109 — disk fullness
      ≥ 80%), sleep ``chunk_pause_seconds`` between EVERY chunk
      regardless of current loadavg. At very high fullness ext4
      thrashing makes every write slow; by the time loadavg crosses
      ``load_pause_threshold`` the SDIO bus is already saturated.
      Proactively yielding every chunk gives the userspace
      ``watchdog`` daemon a reliable scheduling slot.
    * Otherwise (``chunk_pause_always`` is False, the pre-#109
      behavior): if ``load_pause_threshold > 0``, between chunks
      sample ``os.getloadavg()[0]`` and sleep ``chunk_pause_seconds``
      when it exceeds the threshold. The Pi Zero 2 W shares one SDIO
      controller between SD card and WiFi; sustained heavy archive
      I/O can starve the userspace ``watchdog`` daemon long enough
      to trigger the BCM2835 hardware watchdog (90s timeout). This
      yields the daemon enough CPU + ``/dev/watchdog`` write
      bandwidth to keep pinging the kernel. The ``getloadavg``
      syscall is O(1) (~1 µs) and the branch is taken only when
      the box is actually overloaded — zero overhead in the normal
      case.
    * If ``time_budget_seconds > 0``, raise
      :class:`_CopyTimeBudgetExceeded` (an ``OSError`` subclass) if
      the copy takes longer than that many seconds. The caller
      catches this BEFORE the generic ``OSError`` handler and
      releases the claim back to ``pending`` *without* bumping
      ``attempts`` — the next iteration's between-files load-pause
      guard gets a chance to fire. A clip that consistently times
      out is a sign of pathological I/O, not a file defect; we let
      the system breathe rather than push it to ``dead_letter``.

    ``now_fn`` and ``sleep_fn`` are injectable for tests.

    """Walk the just-copied file's SEI and persist a sidecar JSON.

    Called once per successful ``_atomic_copy``, BEFORE
    ``_enqueue_indexed`` adds the file to the indexer queue. The
    file's pages are still hot in the kernel page cache (we just
    wrote them), so the SEI walk costs only the protobuf decode
    work — no extra SD reads. The sidecar lets the indexer's later
    pass skip both the ``mvhd`` walk and the ``extract_sei_messages``
    walk, eliminating ~2x file reads per clip and the associated
    page-cache miss.

    **Time-budget context (issue #104 + review of PR #205).** This
    helper runs OUTSIDE the per-file ``chunk_pause_seconds`` /
    ``per_file_time_budget_seconds`` guards that ``_atomic_copy``
    enforces. That is intentional and safe because:

    * The work here is CPU-bound (protobuf decode on small NAL
      buffers), not I/O-bound — the SD card is not the bottleneck,
      so the SDIO-bus-saturation failure mode the time-budget
      guards exist for does not apply.
    * The file's pages are already resident in the page cache from
      the immediately-prior ``_atomic_copy``, so no fresh SD reads
      occur during the walk.
    * The walk samples every ``_INLINE_SEI_SAMPLE_RATE`` (30) SEI
      NAL — total work is O(file_size / 30), which on a worst-case
      80 MB Tesla clip is well under a second on the Pi Zero 2 W.
    * The downstream `_enqueue_indexed` call is a single SQLite
      INSERT — sub-millisecond.

    To keep that contract observable in production, we measure the
    wall-clock and emit a WARNING if the helper exceeds
    ``_SIDECAR_WRITE_WARN_SECONDS``. That gives operators an early
    signal if the assumption above breaks (e.g. a future change
    drops the sample-rate, or a corrupt clip causes pathological
    parser behaviour) without forcing a hard cap that would silently
    drop the optimization on every slow clip.

    Best-effort: any failure is logged at WARNING and silently
    swallowed. The downstream indexer's existing fallback path
    (``read_sei_sidecar`` returning None → mmap parse) handles
    missing sidecars transparently, so a sidecar-write failure
    only loses the I/O optimization, never data.

    safeguards. Defaults are conservative (off / 0.25 s / off) so
    callers that don't opt in get pre-#104 behavior.

    Issue #109: the ``chunk_pause_seconds`` actually forwarded to
    ``_atomic_copy`` is derived from the base value via
    :func:`_adaptive_chunk_pause`, so past 80% fullness every chunk
    yields SDIO time and past 95% it yields twice as much.
    ``load_pause_threshold`` is forwarded unchanged: it now only picks
    the mid-copy chunk pause on a disk under 80% full, and the loadavg
    correction that used to scale it went out with the loadavg gate
    (2026-08-16 — see the note above :func:`_adaptive_chunk_pause`).

    Pure dispatch logic kept separate from the loop so tests can drive
    it directly without a thread or task_coordinator.

        # WHAT THIS MEASURES, AND WHAT IT USED TO (2026-08-16). The gate

        # asleep for 3.5 of every 6 hours while the queue GREW from 1995
        # to 2148 rows. Loadavg counts tasks in uninterruptible sleep,

        # ``file-storage``, ``jbd2`` and the writeback kworkers — while
        # the CPU sat 89-99% idle with one task runnable out of 150. It
        # was measuring "the SD card is busy", which with a car plugged
        # in is permanently true, and calling that a reason not to work.

        #      every few seconds (see PR #93 review).

        #      a producer's wake() can't shorten the back-off — the
        #      whole point of the pause is to give the watchdog daemon
