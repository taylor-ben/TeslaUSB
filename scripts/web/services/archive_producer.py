"""TeslaUSB Archive Queue Producer — Phase 2a (issue #76).

Single daemon thread that periodically walks the TeslaCam RO mount and
calls :func:`services.archive_queue.enqueue_many_for_archive` for every
file :mod:`services.archive_policy` says this box keeps. Idempotent —
``INSERT OR IGNORE`` on the queue's UNIQUE constraint makes re-walks
cheap.

Under the default ``evidence-only`` policy that is each event's
``event.json``, ``event.mp4`` and ``thumb.png``: no camera clips, and
nothing from ``RecentClips`` at all. Under ``events`` it is whole event
folders; under ``everything`` it is every clip the car writes, which is
what this producer did before 2026-08-16 and what filled the card.

This is the "belt and suspenders" half of the Phase 2a producer set. The
other half is the inotify file watcher (``file_watcher_service``), which
fires individual paths in real time. The producer thread covers:

1. **Boot catch-up** — anything Tesla wrote while ``gadget_web`` was
   down (crash, restart, or normal boot lag) gets enqueued on the
   first iteration.
2. **Inotify gaps** — kernel buffer overflows, transient mount events,
   or simply missed events (the watcher's mp4 callback uses a 60-s
   age gate; the rescan picks up files Tesla finished writing > 60 s
   ago).
3. **VFS cache drift** — when Tesla writes via the gadget block layer,
   the Pi's view of the directory is occasionally stale until the
   next ``readdir``. The periodic rescan forces that ``readdir``.

**Phase 2a is producer-only.** Rows accumulate in ``archive_queue`` but
no worker drains them until Phase 2b. The producer thread therefore
performs zero copy work, no network I/O, and never touches the gadget
or any mount — pure read-side observer.

**Issue #184 Wave 2 — Phase B**: the SEI peek that decides whether a
RecentClips clip is stationary now runs **before** the row is enqueued
(via :func:`enqueue_with_peek`). Stationary clips never become a
queue row, so the worker's pick-claim-stat-skip-mark-row cycle (~6 SD
writes per row) collapses to zero SD writes for the parked-overnight
common case. The skipped count is tallied in an in-memory deque
(:func:`get_skipped_stationary_count`) so the Settings badge still has
a number to show without hitting the DB. The worker-side peek stays as
defense-in-depth for legacy rows already in the queue at upgrade time
and for tests that bypass the producer.

Public API:

* :func:`start_producer(teslacam_root, db_path, *, rescan_interval_seconds, boot_catchup_enabled)` — start the thread (idempotent).
* :func:`stop_producer(timeout)` — signal stop and join. Safe across mode switches.
* :func:`get_producer_status()` — small dict for the observability stub.
* :func:`run_boot_catchup_once(teslacam_root, db_path)` — synchronous
  helper exposed for tests; never call from the request thread.
* :func:`enqueue_with_peek(paths, db_path)` — enqueue a batch with the
  Phase B SEI peek applied to RecentClips candidates.
* :func:`get_skipped_stationary_count(hours)` — return the in-memory
  count of clips skipped at the producer in the last N hours.
* :func:`reset_skipped_stationary_tally()` — clear the in-memory deque
  (for tests and the "clear badge" admin action).

# no GPS-bearing message; we can skip the peek and record the skip
# without touching the file at all.
#
# Why ``mtime`` AND ``size``? Tesla rotates the RecentClips slot by
# overwriting the file in place. The new clip will have a different
# mtime AND a different size (camera bitrates vary clip-to-clip). Any
# mismatch invalidates the cache entry and forces a re-peek.

# enumerates other directories cannot grow this without limit. LRU
# eviction is approximated by deleting the oldest 25% of entries when
# we hit the cap — cheap (one sort) vs. maintaining a true LRU and
# rare enough (only on overflow) that the approximation is fine.

    :func:`enqueue_with_peek` so RecentClips clips with no GPS-bearing
    SEI never become a queue row.

    Issue #214 — VFS cache invalidation: Tesla writes via the gadget
    block layer, which bypasses the Pi's VFS dentry/inode cache. The
    kernel's cache for the FAT-on-loop-on-image RO mount can stay
    stale for tens of minutes when nothing else triggers a refresh
    (no WiFi reconnect, no cloud sync). When that happens, ``readdir``
    on the RO mount returns a frozen snapshot and the producer goes
    blind to Tesla's new clips — long enough to exceed the 60-min
    RecentClips rotation window and lose footage.
    :func:`_refresh_ro_mount` evicts only the slab cache (``echo 2 >
    /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches``); it does NOT touch the mount, loop
    device, image file, or gadget binding. Cost is sub-10ms and the
    function is internally non-fatal (logs and returns on any error).
