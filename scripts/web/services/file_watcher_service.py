"""
TeslaUSB File Watcher Service.

Monitors the USB RO mount and ArchivedClips directory for new video files.
On detection: queues files for geo-indexing and cloud sync.

Uses inotify when available (real-time, low CPU), falls back to polling
(scan every 5 minutes). Designed for Pi Zero 2 W (512MB RAM).

Lifecycle: ``start_watcher`` / ``stop_watcher`` / ``restart_watcher`` are
all safe to call from the Flask request thread or the mode-switch handler.
``stop_watcher`` joins the worker thread so callers can rely on no further
callbacks firing afterwards. A monotonic ``_watcher_generation`` counter is
incremented on every stop, and the worker thread captures its generation
at startup; any callback the thread tries to emit after the counter has
moved is silently dropped, so a slow shutdown (or a mode switch racing a
file-create event) cannot enqueue stale paths into a freshly-restarted
watcher.

    which caches FAT directory entries (dentries) and inodes in slab
    caches. Without explicit invalidation, ``readdir`` on the RO
    mount can return a frozen snapshot for tens of minutes when
    nothing else triggers a refresh — long enough to exceed Tesla's
