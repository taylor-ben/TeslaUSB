    # One-time pipeline_queue backfill (issue #184 Wave 4 — Phase I.1).
    # Idempotent — re-running on every boot is safe (the unique
    # constraint catches duplicates), AND a one-shot completion flag
    # in ``kv_meta`` makes subsequent boots a no-op (so we don't
    # re-scan four legacy tables every restart). Runs on a background
    # daemon thread so it never blocks the request loop.

    # dies abruptly when the process exits. That's fine here because

    # middle of one of the per-table loops just means the next boot
    # re-runs the scan and resumes (the ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING``
    # clause + UNIQUE constraint dedup any partial work). The
    # one-shot flag is only set on a successful end-to-end run.
